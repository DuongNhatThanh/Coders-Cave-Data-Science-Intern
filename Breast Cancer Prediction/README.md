# Breast Cancer Prediction Project## Introduction This project focuses on predicting breast cancer diagnosis using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build accurate predictive models that can classify breast tumors as malignant (M) or benign (B) based on various features extracted from medical images of breast cells.## Data and Preprocessing- The dataset used in this project contains various numeric features related to cell characteristics.- Data cleaning and preprocessing steps were performed, including handling missing values and standardizing the features using Z-score scaling.## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - EDA was conducted to understand the distribution of features and correlations between them.- Visualizations such as heatmaps and pair plots were created to reveal insights about the relationships between different features and diagnosis.## Model Selection and Hyperparameter Tuning - Four different classifiers were chosen: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.- Cross-validation with K-Fold was employed to evaluate and compare the models' performances.- Hyperparameter tuning was carried out using GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters for each model.## Model Evaluation- Models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC metrics.- ROC curves were plotted to visualize the trade-off between true positive and false positive rates for different models.## Results - Logistic Regression achieved the highest accuracy score of approximately 95.9%.- All models demonstrated strong predictive capabilities with ROC-AUC scores above 0.9.- Cross-validation ensured the models' generalization and robustness.## Conclusion This project successfully built and evaluated predictive models for breast cancer diagnosis. The use of cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning enhanced the reliability and generalization of the models. The Logistic Regression model emerged as the best performer in terms of accuracy.
