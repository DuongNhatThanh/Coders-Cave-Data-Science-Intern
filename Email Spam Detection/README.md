# 📧 Spam Detection using Naive Bayes Classifier 🚫This project explores the use of the Naive Bayes Classifier to detect spam emails. The goal is to build a model that can accurately distinguish between spam and non-spam (ham) emails.## 📜 Project OverviewIn this project, we dive into the world of spam detection using the power of the Naive Bayes algorithm. We start by understanding the foundations of Naive Bayes classification, its historical context, and why it's called "naive." Then, we explore its application in various domains like spam detection, character recognition, and more.We delve into the different types of Naive Bayes classifiers: Bernoulli, Gaussian, and Multinomial, understanding their strengths and limitations in handling different types of data.## 🔍 Data Exploration and ProcessingWe load and explore our dataset to gain insights into the distribution of spam and non-spam emails. We preprocess the data by cleaning and organizing it for further analysis.## 🤖 Building and Evaluating the ModelWe build a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier using the `sklearn` library. The raw text data is transformed into numeric vectors using the `CountVectorizer`. We train the model on the training dataset and evaluate its performance on the testing dataset using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report metrics.## 📊 Visualizing ResultsWe enhance our understanding by visualizing the distribution of spam and non-spam emails using a bar chart. This visualization provides an intuitive overview of the model's predictions.## 🧠 TakeawaysNaive Bayes classification serves as a powerful tool for tackling spam detection. However, we explore both the advantages and disadvantages of this approach, shedding light on when it's suitable and where its limitations lie.## 🚀 ConclusionBy the end of this project, we've gained hands-on experience with Naive Bayes classification, enhanced our understanding of text-based spam detection, and learned how to evaluate and visualize the performance of our model.Feel free to explore the code, experiment with hyperparameters, and extend the project further to tackle new challenges in the realm of machine learning and natural language processing.Let's keep our inboxes free from spam! 📥🛡️
